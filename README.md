# Photidian

Photidian is my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive.

The average laptop/destop owner spends five hours/day in front of a computer screen. Photidian is a visual diary of those hours- use the app to take a photo with your webcam every day. You can view them by date or view in a slideshow for a time-lapse effect.
